MinimizePath
============
In windows 7 there is a max number of characters allowed to be in system's PATH environment variable.
This caused me some trouble, because I use many programs that set their paths there.

MinimizePath application is a small application created to reduce the number of characters in 
the PATH environment variable of windows 7.

you can change it very easily for your own use,
Hope you will find it useful.
